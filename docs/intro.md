# Introduction

**Baltica** is a comprehensive Minecraft Bedrock toolkit designed to provide developers with the tools they need for creating bots, servers, and packet manipulation utilities.

## Installation

Get started with Baltica by installing it via npm:

```bash
npm install baltica
```

## What is Baltica?

Baltica is a powerful Minecraft Bedrock client library that offers three main components:

### ü§ñ Bot Client
Create and manage Minecraft Bedrock bots with ease. Perfect for automation, testing, or creating helpful server utilities.

### üñ•Ô∏è Bare Bones Server
A lightweight server implementation that handles the essential connection and login process. Note that this server provides the foundation up to the login phase - it does not include player spawning or world management, as these are complex features better handled by dedicated server implementations like [SerenityJS](https://serenityjs.org/).

### üåâ Bridge (MITM Proxy)
A powerful man-in-the-middle proxy for intercepting, analyzing, and modifying Minecraft Bedrock Edition packets. Perfect for debugging, packet analysis, and protocol research.
